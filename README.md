# PyCore
A simple & lightweight server core for Supercell games written on Python

## Requirements
* [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

## Setup
1. Download the repository by zip or type this into the Terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Greedycell/PyCore.git`
2. Go into Command Prompt or Terminal and type: `py main.py`
3. Now it is finished and you can use any Supercell client to connect to your server.

## Why does the game not work?
This repository is only the core of a server, you need to implement all the packets and logic yourself.
